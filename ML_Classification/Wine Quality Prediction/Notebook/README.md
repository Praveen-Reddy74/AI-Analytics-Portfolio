## Models Implemented
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Bagging Classifier**
- **AdaBoost Classifier**

Additionally, **K-Fold Cross Validation** was applied to assess model robustness and consistency across multiple data splits.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Training Accuracy
- Test Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-Validation Accuracy
- Out-of-Bag (OOB) Score (for Bagging)
- Model comparison plots (Train vs Test Accuracy)
