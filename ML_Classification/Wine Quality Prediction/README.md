#  Wine Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying wine quality using supervised machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to evaluate and compare ensemble models against a baseline Decision Tree to understand performance improvements in terms of accuracy, generalization, and stability.

Both **red** and **white** wine datasets are used, containing physicochemical properties that influence wine quality.
