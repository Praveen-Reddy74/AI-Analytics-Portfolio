## Evaluation Metrics
To ensure reliable and clinically meaningful results, the following metrics were used:

- Mean Cross-Validation Accuracy
- Standard Deviation of CV Accuracy
- Train Accuracy vs Test Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

Special emphasis was placed on **F1-score**, as accuracy alone can be misleading for imbalanced datasets.

## Results Summary
- Ensemble models consistently outperformed single classifiers.
- **Extra Trees and Random Forest with SMOTE** achieved the best balance between accuracy and generalization.
- SMOTE significantly improved minority-class detection and F1 scores.
- Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced model stability and reduced overfitting.
- Cross-validation confirmed consistent performance across different data splits.
