**Long-Term Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Using Clinical and Lifestyle Indicators**

**Background**

Cardiovascular disorders develop progressively due to a combination of demographic factors, lifestyle habits, and clinical measurements. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is rarely caused by a single condition; instead, it emerges from the interaction of multiple risk factors such as smoking intensity, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, metabolic health, and age.

A healthcare analytics team has collected anonymized patient records during routine medical examinations. These patients were monitored over an extended period to observe whether they experienced a major coronary event. The collected data reflects real-world clinical complexity, where risk factors often coexist and influence each other.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to build a classification system that predicts whether a patient is likely to experience a coronary heart disease event during a long-term follow-up period.

The resulting model should support preventive healthcare by:

- Flagging individuals who may require closer medical attention
- Assisting clinicians in early risk stratification
- Providing a data-driven understanding of long-term cardiovascular risk

- **Target Variable**
TenYearCHD: Long-term coronary heart disease outcome
1 → Coronary event observed
0 → No coronary event observed
