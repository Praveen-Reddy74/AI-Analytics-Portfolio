**Case Study: Promotion Decision System at NexaCore Solutions**

You are a Data Scientist at NexaCore Solutions, a multinational organization with a geographically distributed workforce and diverse functional units. The company invests heavily in employee training, performance evaluation, and leadership development programs.

Despite a well-defined promotion policy, recent internal audits have uncovered significant inconsistencies in promotion outcomes across departments and regions.

**Senior leadership has raised concerns regarding:**

Unequal promotion probabilities for employees with similar performance profiles
Department-level subjectivity and favoritism
Lack of transparency in promotion decisions
To eliminate bias and introduce accountability, the organization has decided to implement a machine learning–driven promotion recommendation system.

**Problem Statement**

Your task is to build a binary classification system that predicts:

Whether an employee should be promoted (is_promoted = 1) or not (is_promoted = 0)

based on historical employee data.

The system will serve as a decision-support tool for the HR department and will directly influence promotion recommendations.
