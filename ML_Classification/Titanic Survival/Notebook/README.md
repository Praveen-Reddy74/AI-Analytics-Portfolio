## Methodology
The workflow follows standard machine learning practices:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding and scaling
3. Train–test split
4. Model training
5. Performance evaluation using classification metrics

---

## Models Implemented
The following models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

These models were compared to understand the difference between linear and tree-based learning approaches.
