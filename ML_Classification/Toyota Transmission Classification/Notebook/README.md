## Methodology
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Train–test split
5. Training multiple classification models
6. Model evaluation using performance metrics
7. Comparative analysis of model results

## Models Implemented
The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

These models were compared to identify the best-performing approach based on accuracy and generalization.
