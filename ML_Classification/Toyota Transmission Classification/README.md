# Toyota Transmission Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **transmission type** (Automatic or Manual) of Toyota vehicles using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze vehicle specifications and build classification models that can accurately determine transmission type based on engine, performance, and vehicle attributes.

The project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow, including data exploration, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
