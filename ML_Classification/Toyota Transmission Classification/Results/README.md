## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was assessed using:

- Training Accuracy
- Test Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of model behavior on unseen data.

## Results Summary
- Ensemble models consistently outperformed single classifiers.
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved the highest prediction accuracy.
- Tree-based models captured non-linear relationships effectively.
- Simpler models such as Logistic Regression performed reasonably but were less accurate than ensemble approaches.
