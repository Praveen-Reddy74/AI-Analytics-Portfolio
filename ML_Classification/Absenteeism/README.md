Decision tree usning entropy

Project Background / Story¶
A manufacturing company has been experiencing inconsistent employee attendance, which has begun to affect productivity and project timelines.
To better understand the factors contributing to absenteeism, the HR Analytics team has collected comprehensive data on employees.
This includes demographic details, lifestyle habits, work-related variables, and health indicators.

The goal of this project is to analyze absenteeism behaviour and build predictive models that classify employees based on their level of absenteeism.
This helps the organization manage workforce planning, employee well-being, and operational efficiency.

The original target variable, Absenteeism time in hours, has to be converted into three categories using the following rule:

Low: ≤ 2 hours
Medium: 3–5 hours
High: > 5 hours
This categorized target variable shoule be stored as:

Absenteeism category
