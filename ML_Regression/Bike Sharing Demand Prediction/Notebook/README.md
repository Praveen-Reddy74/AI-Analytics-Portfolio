## Methodology
The project follows a structured regression workflow:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Train–test split
4. Training multiple regression models
5. Performance evaluation using R² score
6. Bias–variance analysis
7. Prediction on new unseen input data
