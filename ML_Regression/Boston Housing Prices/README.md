# Boston House Price Prediction using Ensemble Regression and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using regression models with an emphasis on **ensemble learning and hyperparameter optimization**. The objective is to compare baseline models with tuned ensemble models and analyze how hyperparameter choices influence predictive performance.

The project demonstrates advanced model optimization techniques using Grid Search and Randomized Search Cross Validation.
