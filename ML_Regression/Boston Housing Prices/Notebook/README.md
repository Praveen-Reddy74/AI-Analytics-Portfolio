## Methodology
The project follows a structured regression workflow:

1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
2. Train–test split
3. Baseline model training
4. Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Randomized Search
5. Performance evaluation using R² score
6. Visualization of hyperparameter interactions
7. Comparative analysis of tuned models

## Models Implemented
The following regression models were trained and optimized:

- Decision Tree Regressor
- Bagging Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

Both **Grid Search** and **Randomized Search** were used to explore optimal hyperparameter configurations.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:

- R² Score (Test Set)
- Cross-Validation Performance
- Bias–Variance Tradeoff Analysis

These metrics help assess both accuracy and generalization.
